# Innomatics Internship Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the Innomatics Research Labs internship assignment. The project focuses on integrating data from multiple sources, performing data cleaning, and generating analytical insights using Python.

## Overview
- Combined data from CSV, JSON, and SQL sources into a single dataset  
- Performed data cleaning and column normalization  
- Created a unified dataset as the single source of truth  
- Answered analytical and conceptual questions using Python and Pandas  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Google Colab  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Usage
The analysis can be executed either in Google Colab or locally using Jupyter Notebook.  
To run locally, ensure Python is installed, install required libraries (`pip install pandas`), start Jupyter Notebook, and run the provided `.ipynb` file.

## Data Sources
The following datasets were **provided as part of the assignment**:
- `orders.csv` – Order transaction data  
- `users.json` – User master data  
- `restaurants.sql` – Restaurant data containing cuisine and ratings  

The final processed dataset (`final_food_delivery_dataset.csv`) was generated after merging and cleaning these sources.

## Notes
All analysis, results, and answers are available in the final notebook included in this repository.
